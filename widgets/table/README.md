# Documentation drafr for the Table widget

# Client-side table widget (table.xxx.js)

## Code organization

### OOP pattern

The data source and cell processor JavaScript classes use the simple parasitic combination inheritance pattern described here:

- http://javascriptissexy.com/oop-in-javascript-what-you-need-to-know/
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript

```

// Parent class with a method
var SuperClass = function(params) {}
SuperClass.prototype.someMethod = function() {}

// Child class
var SubClass = function(params) {
    // Call the parent constructor
    SuperClass.call(this, params)
}

SubClass.prototype = Object.create(SuperClass.prototype)
SubClass.prototype.constructor = SubClass

// Child class methods can be defined only after the prototype
// is updated in the two previous lines

SubClass.prototype.someMethod = function() {
    // Call the parent method
    SuperClass.prototype.someMethod.call(this)
};

```

### Namespaces

All classes for the table widget are be defined in the **$.oc.table** namespace. Cell processors are be defined in the **$.oc.table.processor** namespace. The client and server memory data sources are defined in the **$.oc.table.datasource** namespace.

### Client-side performance and memory usage considerations

The classes defined for the Table widget should follow the best practices in order to achieve the high performance and avoid memory leaks:

* All references to JavaScript objects and DOM elements should be cleared with the `dispose()` methods.
* All event handlers registered in the control should be unregistered with the `dispose()` method.
* DOM manipulations should only be performed in the detached tree with the `DocumentFragment` objects.
* The number of registered event handlers should be kept as low as possible. Cell processors should rely to delegated events registered for the table.
* Cell processors should have the `dispose()` method that unregisters the event handlers and does all required cleanup actions.
* Do not use closures for event handlers. This gives more control over the variable scope and simplifies the cleanup operations.
* If closures are used for anything, use named closures to simplify the profiling process with Chrome dev tools.

There are several articles that provide a good insight into the high performance JavaScript code and efficient memory management:

* http://www.toptal.com/javascript/javascript-prototypes-scopes-and-performance-what-you-need-to-know
* http://developer.nokia.com/community/wiki/JavaScript_Performance_Best_Practices (the suggestion about the code comments is doubtful JS engines now compile code).

## Widget usage

Any `DIV` elements that have the `data-control="table"` attributes are automatically picked up by the control.

```
<div data=control="table" data-columns="{...}"></div>
```

### Options

The options below are listed in the JavaScript notation. Corresponding data attribtues would look like `data-client-data-source-class`. 

- `clientDataSource–°lass` (default is **client**)- specifies the client-side data source class. There are two data source classes supported on the client side - **client** and **server**.
- `data` - specifies the data in JSON format for the **client**.
- `recordsPerPage` - specifies how many records per page to display. If the value is not defined or `false` or `null`, the pagination feature is disabled and all records are displayed.
- `columns` - column definitions in JSON format, see the server-side column definition format below.

## Data sources ($.oc.table.datasource)

### Client memory data source ($.oc.table.datasource.client)

The client memory data sources keeps the data in the client memory. The data is loaded from the control element's `data` property (`data-data` attribute) and posted back with the form data.

### Server memory data source ($.oc.table.datasource.server)

**TODO:** document this 

## Cell processors ($.oc.table.processor)

Cell processors are responsible for rendering the cell content, creating the cell data editors and updating the cell value in the grid control. There is a single cell processor per the table column. All rows in a specific column are handled with a same cell processor.

Cell processors should use the table's `setCellValue()` method to update the value in the table. The table class, in turn, will commit the changes to the data source when the user navigates to another row, on the pagination event, search or form submit. The `setCellValue()` should be the only way to update the table data by cell processors.

Cell processors should register delegated events to detect user's interaction with the cells they responsible for. The processors should unregister any event handlers in the `dispose()` method. The even handlers should be registered for the widgwet's top element, not for the table, as the table could be rebuilt completely on pagination, search, and other cases.

### Removing editors from the table

The table keeps a reference to the currently active cell processor. The cell processor objects have the `activeCell` property that is a reference to the cell which currently has an editor. The table calls the `hideEditor()` method of the active cell processor and the cell processor removes the editor from the active cell.

### Showing editors

The table object calls the `onFocus()` method of the cell processors when a cell is clicked or navigated (with the keyboard). The cell processor can build a cell editor when this method is called, if it's required.

## Column definitions

Columns are defined as array with the `columns` property. The array keys correspond the column identifiers. The array elements are associative arrays with the following keys:

- title
- type (string, checkbox, dropdown, autocomplete)
- width
- readonly
- options (for drop-down elements and autocomplete types)
